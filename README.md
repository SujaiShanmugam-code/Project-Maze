# 🧩🌀Maze Solver with Coin Collection

## 🔗 Overview

This project solves a maze using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** while collecting coins along the way. The maze is represented in a text file, where 'S' denotes the start point, 'G' is the goal, 'X' represents walls, and numbers (0-9) represent the number of coins in the respective cell. The goal is to find the shortest path from 'S' to 'G', collecting as many coins as possible.

### ✏️ Problem Description:
- **Start Point ('S')**: The starting position in the maze.
- **Goal ('G')**: The target point to reach.
- **Walls ('X')**: Obstacles that cannot be traversed.
- **Coins (0-9)**: Values that represent the number of coins in each passage cell.
- **Movement**: The program allows both orthogonal and diagonal movement.
- **Objective**: To find the shortest path from 'S' to 'G' while collecting coins.

## 🛡️ Algorithm Used

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is used to explore the maze.
